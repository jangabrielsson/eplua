# Alternative Approach: Frame-Based HTML Labels

## Problem Analysis
The tkinter `Text` widget is designed for text editing, not for display labels. Even with our fixes:
- Content is correct ✅
- Size calculations are correct ✅  
- But visual display is still clipped ❌

## Root Cause
`Text` widgets don't behave like `Label` widgets for auto-sizing. They have their own sizing logic that doesn't align well with our needs.

## Alternative Solution
Instead of fighting against tkinter's Text widget behavior, use tkinter's strengths:

### Option 1: Frame + Multiple Labels
- Parse HTML into segments
- Create individual `ttk.Label` widgets for each formatted segment
- Pack them in a `Frame` to create the complete formatted text
- Let tkinter's natural Label sizing handle everything

### Option 2: Canvas-Based Rendering  
- Use `tk.Canvas` to draw text with formatting
- More control over positioning and sizing
- More complex but potentially more reliable

### Option 3: Rich Text with Tkinter.Text Improvements
- Keep using Text widget but with better configuration
- Use `bbox` measurements for accurate sizing
- Handle scrolling and viewport issues properly

## Recommendation
Try **Option 1** first - it aligns with tkinter's natural behavior and should "just work" for sizing.
